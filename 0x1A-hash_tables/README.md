# Hash Table
A **hash table** is a powerful data structure that facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. It boasts constant-time average complexity for fundamental operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.

## How it Operates
In the realm of hash tables, keys undergo a transformation into indices within an array through the use of a **hash function**. This function takes a key as input, produces a hash code, and employs it as the index to store or retrieve the associated value. This direct mapping ensures rapid access to stored values, making hash tables particularly adept at search operations.

## Key Attributes
- **Swift Access**: Hash tables deliver constant-time average complexity for fundamental operations, making them invaluable for scenarios where speedy data access is paramount.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Many hash table implementations dynamically adjust their size to maintain an equilibrium between the number of elements and the array's size, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Collision Handling**: Collisions, arising when two keys generate the same hash code, are managed through diverse strategies like chaining or open addressing.

## Applications
Hash tables find widespread use in computer science and programming, proving indispensable in applications such as database indexing, caches, and symbol tables within compilers.
